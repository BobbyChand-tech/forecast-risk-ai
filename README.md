# AI-Augmented Salesforce Forecast Risk & Confidence Scoring

## Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can be responsibly applied to enterprise sales analytics
to assess forecast confidence and highlight pipeline risk for senior leadership.

Rather than reporting forecast numbers alone, the solution focuses on identifying where
those forecasts may be unreliable and where leadership intervention is required.

## Key Features
- Rule-based forecast risk scoring (transparent and explainable)
- Identification of high-risk, high-value opportunities
- Confidence banding to support decision-making
- AI-ready executive briefing generation
- Designed for secure and regulated environments (no external API dependency)

## Why It Matters
Sales forecasts often appear precise but hide underlying risk.
This approach adds judgement, context, and confidence to pipeline reviews,
enabling leaders to act earlier and more effectively.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Simulated Salesforce opportunity data

## Outputs
- Risk-scored opportunity dataset
- Executive-ready briefing prompt (`exec_summary.txt`)
